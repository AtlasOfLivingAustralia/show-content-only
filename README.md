# show-content-only
WordPress plugin to show a post/page's content without header/footer/CSS etc.

This is a modified version of the [Show Content Only plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-content-only/) developed by Katz Web Services.

ALA's only modification is to add a `<title>` element and a `<meta>` element with the page/post ID to the HTML returned for `content-only` requests.

ALA uses the Show Content Only plugin in WordPress to support import and indexing of WordPress pages by BIE so WordPress pages are shown in general search results.
